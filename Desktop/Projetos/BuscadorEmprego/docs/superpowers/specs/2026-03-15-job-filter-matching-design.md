# Job Filter & Matching System — Design Spec
**Date:** 2026-03-15
**Project:** BuscadorEmprego
**Status:** Approved

---

## 1. Problem Statement

The current system scrapes job listings from Indeed via Playwright and persists all results indiscriminately. This is insufficient because:

1. Indeed's ToS explicitly prohibits scraping bots; Cloudflare anti-bot blocks headless Playwright quickly and reliably.
2. There is no filtering logic — the system would apply to every scraped job regardless of relevance.
3. The `CandidateProfile` model lacks job preferences, salary expectations, and fields required by application forms.

This spec defines the **job filtering, profile preferences, and multi-source discovery** system that makes automated applications safe, targeted, and useful.

---

## 2. Goals

- Replace the Indeed Playwright scraper with **SerpAPI** (Google Jobs aggregator) for job discovery — no CAPTCHA, no ToS violation, structured data.
- Filter discovered jobs against the candidate's preferences **before** saving or applying.
- Enrich persisted jobs with a **skill match percentage** (informational, not a gate).
- Keep Playwright for the **apply step only** (opening the real job board URL and submitting the form).
- Support these sources: **Indeed, Glassdoor, RemoteOK, WeWorkRemotely, Wellfound**. Exclude LinkedIn.
- Extend `CandidateProfile` with `preferences: JobPreferences` and all fields needed for application forms.

---

## 3. Architecture Overview

```
profile.json
    ↓
[1] SerpAPIConnector         ← queries Google Jobs via SerpAPI REST API
    ↓  list[JobDTO]
[2] SourceFilter             ← keep only allowed sources (indeed, glassdoor, remoteok, etc.)
    ↓
[3] JobFilter                ← rule-based: modality, keywords, salary, location, seniority
    ↓  (approved DTOs + rejection reasons for skipped)
[4] SkillMatcher             ← computes skill_match_pct; does NOT gate candidacy
    ↓
[5] job_service.upsert()     ← persists approved jobs to SQLite; skipped jobs saved with status="skipped" + reason
    ↓
[6] ApplyService             ← Playwright opens real job board URL and fills the form
    ↓
[7] ApplicationLog           ← screenshot, result, apply_timestamp
```

**Layer contracts:**
- `SerpAPIConnector` returns `list[JobDTO]` only — no SQLAlchemy imports.
- `FilterService` and `SkillMatcher` are pure functions — no I/O, no DB, no Playwright.
- `ApplyService` is the only layer that imports Playwright.
- `api/` never imports connectors or Playwright directly.

**Note on `SourceFilter`:** `SourceFilter` is NOT a separate class. It is the `check_source` rule, the first step inside `apply_filters` in `filter_service.py`. The architecture diagram labels it separately for clarity, but the implementation is a single rule in the filter chain.

## 4. Profile Schema

### 4.1 `CandidateProfile` (updated dataclass)

The existing `models/profile.py` is fully replaced. The field `roles: list[str]` is **removed** (superseded by `preferences.keywords_required`). All other existing fields (`name`, `email`, `phone`, `location`, `skills`, `cv_path`, `answers`) are preserved with identical names. New fields are added.

```python
@dataclass
class JobPreferences:
    modality: list[str]                    # ["remote"]
    min_salary_brl: float                  # 20000.0
    usd_to_brl_rate: float                 # 5.8
    eur_to_brl_rate: float                 # 6.3
    salary_missing: str                    # "include_flagged" | "skip"
    sources_allowed: list[str]             # ["indeed", "glassdoor", ...]
    locations_allowed: list[str]           # ["remote", "united states", ...]
    languages_allowed: list[str]           # ["english", "portuguese"]
    keywords_required: list[str]           # at least one must appear in title/summary
    keywords_blocked: list[str]            # none may appear in title/summary/location
    seniority_allowed: list[str]           # ["mid", "senior", "lead", ...]
    apply_mode: str                        # "auto" | "review" | "off"
    max_applications_per_day: int          # 10
    max_results_per_run: int               # 50
    search_queries: list[str]              # SerpAPI query strings

@dataclass
class CandidateProfile:
    # --- existing fields (unchanged) ---
    name: str
    email: str
    phone: str
    location: str
    skills: list[str]
    cv_path: str
    answers: dict[str, str]
    # --- removed: roles: list[str]  (replaced by preferences.keywords_required) ---
    # --- new fields ---
    linkedin_url: str
    portfolio_url: str | None
    github_url: str | None
    current_role: str
    current_company: str
    years_experience: int
    desired_salary_brl: float
    preferences: JobPreferences
```

`load_profile(path: Path) -> CandidateProfile` continues to use `CandidateProfile(**data)` but now `data["preferences"]` is first converted to a `JobPreferences` instance:

```python
def load_profile(path: Path) -> CandidateProfile:
    data = json.loads(path.read_text(encoding="utf-8"))
    data["preferences"] = JobPreferences(**data["preferences"])
    return CandidateProfile(**data)
```

## 5. New Components

### 5.1 `connectors/serpapi.py` — `SerpAPIConnector`

Replaces `IndeedConnector` for **discovery only**. `SerpAPIConnector` does **not** implement the `JobConnector` Protocol (which requires `fetch_jobs(search_url, max_results)` — a URL-based signature). The Protocol is intentionally not used for SerpAPI because discovery is query-based, not URL-based. The `JobConnector` Protocol remains valid for `IndeedConnector` (apply-only path). `SerpAPIConnector` is used directly by `job_service`, not via Protocol dispatch.

```python
class SerpAPIConnector:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str) -> None: ...
    async def fetch_jobs(self, query: str, num: int = 10) -> list[JobDTO]: ...
```

- Calls `https://serpapi.com/search.json?engine=google_jobs&q={query}&num={num}`
- Maps response fields to `JobDTO`: title, company, location, url, summary, source (detected from `via` field), salary_raw (raw string when present)
- Adds `salary_raw: str | None` to `JobDTO` to carry unparsed salary text through the pipeline
- Does NOT import SQLAlchemy

**Source detection from SerpAPI `via` field:**

| `via` contains | `source` value |
|----------------|---------------|
| "Indeed" | "indeed" |
| "Glassdoor" | "glassdoor" |
| "Remote OK" / "RemoteOK" | "remoteok" |
| "We Work Remotely" | "weworkremotely" |
| "Wellfound" / "AngelList" | "wellfound" |
| anything else | "other" |

### 5.2 `services/filter_service.py` — `JobFilter`

Pure functions. No I/O.

```python
@dataclass
class FilterResult:
    approved: list[JobDTO]
    rejected: list[tuple[JobDTO, str]]   # (dto, reason)

def apply_filters(dtos: list[JobDTO], prefs: JobPreferences) -> FilterResult: ...
```

**Filter chain (applied in order, first failure = reject):**

| Filter | Logic |
|--------|-------|
| `check_source` | `dto.source in prefs.sources_allowed` |
| `check_modality` | At least one value from `prefs.modality` (e.g. `"remote"`) or its Portuguese equivalent (`"remoto"`) appears in `dto.location.lower()` **OR** `dto.title.lower()`. The current profile requires `modality: ["remote"]`; the rule must iterate `prefs.modality` rather than hardcode the string. |
| `check_blocked_keywords` | none of `keywords_blocked` appear in title+summary+location (case-insensitive) |
| `check_required_keywords` | at least one of `keywords_required` is a substring of title or summary (case-insensitive) |
| `check_location` | `check_modality` already passed (remote jobs are location-agnostic), **OR** any of `locations_allowed` is a substring of `dto.location.lower()` |
| `check_salary` | salary ≥ min (after currency conversion), OR salary absent → flag but pass |
| `check_language` | detect language of `dto.summary` via `langdetect` (seeded with `DetectorFactory.seed = 0` for determinism); pass if detected language is in `languages_allowed`, or if `summary` is `None`, or if detection raises `LangDetectException` |

**Salary parsing from `salary_raw`:**
- Detect currency symbol: `$` → USD, `€` → EUR, `R$` → BRL, no symbol → assume job's country currency
- Extract numeric range (e.g. "$80k–$120k/yr") → take lower bound
- Convert to BRL using rates from `prefs`
- If parsing fails → treat as missing → `salary_missing` policy applies

### 5.3 `services/skill_matcher.py` — `SkillMatcher`

```python
def compute_match(summary: str | None, candidate_skills: list[str]) -> int:
    """Returns 0-100. 0 if summary is None."""
```

- Lowercases summary and skills
- Counts how many candidate skills appear as substrings in summary
- Returns `matched / total_skills * 100` rounded to nearest int
- Result stored in `Job.skill_match_pct` (new column, nullable int)

### 5.4 Updated `JobDTO`

```python
class JobDTO(BaseModel):
    source: str
    title: str
    company: str
    location: str
    url: str
    summary: str | None
    is_easy_apply: bool
    salary_raw: str | None = None       # new: raw salary string from source
    salary_flagged: bool = False         # new: True when salary absent/unparseable
```

### 5.5 Updated `Job` ORM model

New columns:
- `salary_raw: Text nullable` — raw salary string as scraped
- `salary_flagged: Boolean default False` — True when salary was absent or unparseable
- `skill_match_pct: Integer nullable` — 0–100, computed by SkillMatcher
- `filter_reason: String(255) nullable` — rejection reason for skipped jobs

### 5.6 Updated `JobSchema` (Pydantic response model)

`JobSchema` in `models/job.py` is updated to expose all new fields in API responses:

```python
class JobSchema(BaseModel):
    model_config = {"from_attributes": True}
    id: int
    source: str
    title: str
    company: str
    location: str
    url: str
    summary: str | None
    is_easy_apply: bool
    collected_at: datetime
    status: Literal["new", "applied", "skipped"]
    salary_raw: str | None        # new
    salary_flagged: bool          # new
    skill_match_pct: int | None   # new
    filter_reason: str | None     # new
```

---

## 6. Database Migration Strategy

This spec adds 4 new columns to the `Job` table. The codebase uses `Base.metadata.create_all(engine)` which only creates tables that do not exist — it does NOT add columns to existing tables.

**Policy: drop-and-recreate on schema change (dev/local only).**

Since BuscadorEmprego is a single-user local tool with no production data to preserve, the migration strategy is:

1. Delete `jobs.db` before the first run after upgrading.
2. `init_db()` recreates all tables from scratch with the new schema.
3. A `--reset-db` CLI flag (or clear instruction in the README) is added to make this explicit.

No Alembic, no `ALTER TABLE`. This is intentional for MVP simplicity. A future spec may introduce Alembic if persistent history becomes important.

---

## 7. Config Changes

New entries in `.env` / `config.py`:

```env
SERP_API_KEY=your_serpapi_key_here
```

```python
class Settings(BaseSettings):
    ...
    serp_api_key: str = ""
```

New entries in `requirements.txt`:
```
langdetect>=1.0.9
httpx>=0.27.0
```

`httpx.AsyncClient` is used by `SerpAPIConnector` for async HTTP calls to the SerpAPI REST endpoint. `requests` is not used because `fetch_jobs` is `async`.

**`indeed_email` and `indeed_password`** in `config.py` are changed from required to optional (default `""`), since Indeed is no longer used for discovery. They remain in `.env.example` as comments for the Phase 2 apply step:

```python
class Settings(BaseSettings):
    indeed_email: str = ""
    indeed_password: str = ""
    serp_api_key: str = ""
    ...
```

---

## 8. Updated `job_service.py`

### 8.1 `upsert_job` helper (new internal function)

Extracted from the existing inline upsert logic in `fetch_and_persist`. Signature:

```python
def _upsert_job(
    session,
    dto: JobDTO,
    *,
    status: str = "new",
    skill_match_pct: int | None = None,
    filter_reason: str | None = None,
) -> Job:
    """Insert or update a Job row by URL. Returns the Job ORM instance."""
```

- Looks up existing `Job` by `url`; creates if not found
- Updates `salary_raw`, `salary_flagged`, `skill_match_pct`, `filter_reason` on every call (idempotent)
- **Status transition rules:**
  - If the row does not exist → set to the given `status`
  - If existing status is `"applied"` → never overwrite (preserve applied history)
  - If existing status is `"skipped"` and the incoming `status` is `"new"` → **update to `"new"`** (job re-passed the filter; allow retry)
  - Otherwise → update to the given `status`

### 8.2 `fetch_and_persist` (updated signature)

The existing `fetch_and_persist(search_url: str, max_results: int)` signature is **replaced** with:

```python
async def fetch_and_persist(profile: CandidateProfile) -> dict:
    """Returns {"total_found": int, "approved": int, "skipped": int}"""
```

**Return value change:** old keys (`found`, `new`, `jobs`) are replaced with `total_found`, `approved`, `skipped`. The `jobs` list is no longer returned (callers should query the DB).

**Test migration:** existing `test_job_service.py` tests that call `fetch_and_persist` must be updated to:
1. Pass a `CandidateProfile` (use the `sample_profile` fixture)
2. Assert on `result["total_found"]`, `result["approved"]`, `result["skipped"]`
3. Patch `SerpAPIConnector.fetch_jobs` (not `IndeedConnector`)

The `api/` layer (to be built in a subsequent task) will load the profile from `settings.profile_path` and pass it here.

**Session handling:** the sync `Session` factory from `db.database` is retained unchanged. `SerpAPIConnector` is async (uses `httpx.AsyncClient`) but `_upsert_job` is synchronous — both can coexist in an `async def` function by awaiting the connector and calling the session synchronously.

```python
async def fetch_and_persist(profile: CandidateProfile) -> dict:
    prefs = profile.preferences
    connector = SerpAPIConnector(settings.serp_api_key)
    all_dtos: list[JobDTO] = []
    num_per_query = max(1, prefs.max_results_per_run // max(1, len(prefs.search_queries)))
    for query in prefs.search_queries[:5]:          # cap at 5 queries per run
        dtos = await connector.fetch_jobs(query, num=num_per_query)
        all_dtos.extend(dtos)

    result = apply_filters(all_dtos, prefs)

    session_factory = _get_session()
    with session_factory() as session:
        # Persist approved
        for dto in result.approved:
            match_pct = compute_match(dto.summary, profile.skills)
            _upsert_job(session, dto, skill_match_pct=match_pct)
        # Persist rejected as skipped
        for dto, reason in result.rejected:
            _upsert_job(session, dto, status="skipped", filter_reason=reason)
        session.commit()

    return {
        "total_found": len(all_dtos),
        "approved": len(result.approved),
        "skipped": len(result.rejected),
    }
```

## 9. Error Handling

| Error | Handling |
|-------|----------|
| SerpAPI quota exceeded (429) | Raise `SerpAPIQuotaError`; API returns HTTP 429 |
| SerpAPI auth failure (401) | Raise `SerpAPIAuthError`; API returns HTTP 401 |
| No jobs found | Return empty list, no error |
| Salary parse failure | Treat as missing; apply `salary_missing` policy |
| `langdetect` failure | Default to pass (do not reject based on language) |
| Apply blocked by CAPTCHA | `CaptchaError` propagated; job status set to `new` (retry later) |

---

## 10. Testing Strategy

All new services are pure functions → unit tests with no mocks needed.

| Test file | What it covers |
|-----------|---------------|
| `tests/test_filter_service.py` | Each rule independently: `check_source`, `check_modality`, `check_blocked_keywords`, `check_required_keywords`, `check_location`, `check_salary`, `check_language`; edge cases: no summary, unicode accents, mixed case, salary in USD/EUR/BRL |
| `tests/test_skill_matcher.py` | 0% match (no skills in summary), 50% match, 100% match, `None` summary → 0 |
| `tests/test_serpapi_connector.py` | Source detection for all 5 boards + "other"; DTO field mapping from a hardcoded mock JSON response (no HTTP call) |
| `tests/test_profile.py` | Full `CandidateProfile` round-trip from JSON; `JobPreferences` nested loading; `None` for optional fields (`portfolio_url`, `github_url`) |
| `tests/test_job_service.py` (extend) | `fetch_and_persist` with patched `SerpAPIConnector.fetch_jobs`; verify approved/skipped counts; verify `_upsert_job` idempotency (same URL twice = one row) |

**Note on `langdetect` determinism:** all tests that invoke `check_language` must call `DetectorFactory.seed = 0` in the test module or a `conftest.py` fixture to ensure reproducible language detection results.

## 11. Out of Scope (This Phase)

- Live currency rate API (use fixed rates from profile)
- LinkedIn as a source
- AI-based compatibility scoring (Phase 3)
- Notification/email on job found
- Web UI / dashboard
- Multi-profile support
